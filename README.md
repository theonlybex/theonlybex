## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**theonlybex/theonlybex** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects related to automatization and web development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about serious games in my game development class and how canm any game become serious with a little work, at the same time i am concepts of machine learning and how it can help people and I also am learning how to solve algorithmic problems such as Leetcode coding questions (patterns, data structures and a few programming languages)
- ðŸ‘¯ Favourite hobby is not started yet, but i would love to start creating small videos for youtube, maybe i would show my journey 

#Thank you for visiting my README
#Hopefully you learned a bit about me 
#Have a great day !!!
